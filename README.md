# FluentFlow
> Code without.. coding
## Description
FluentFlow is application for non-programmers to start coding.
It's ideal for people who want's to start coding but don't know how.
With FluentFlow you can code with Flows and Blocks.
You can just add block, change some properties and when you are finished you can run a test and if you want even publish it!
You can publish your Flow straight via FluentFlow through Publish button where you can change some deployment settings and then publish your Flow to FlagBucket, GitHub or even just to export it to your computer.
## Why this repository?
It is because this repository is not for beginners in programming and even not for beginners in coding in FluentFlow. It is for developers who want's to enhance FluentFlow via Packages! 
Packages are something like mods. You can code your own blocks to make custom behaviour in C#
